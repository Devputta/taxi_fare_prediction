Taxi Fare Prediction using ML project

The term "taxi fare" refers to the amount of money a passenger is charged for using a taxi service to travel from one location to another. The cost of a taxi fare is determined by various factors, including:

1) Distance Traveled: In most cases, taxi fares are based on the distance traveled. Longer distances generally result in higher fares.

2) Time of Travel: Some taxi services may have different rates during peak hours or late at night. This is often known as "peak time" pricing.

3) Base Fare: The initial cost incurred as soon as a passenger enters the taxi is known as the base fare. This is a fixed amount that passengers are charged regardless of the distance traveled.

4) Waiting Time: If the taxi is stationary or moving at a slow pace due to traffic or other reasons, passengers may be charged for the waiting time.

5) Additional Fees: There may be additional charges for tolls, luggage, or specific services, depending on the taxi service and local regulations.

The calculation of taxi fares can vary from one location to another and is often regulated by local authorities. Many taxi services use meters to automatically calculate fares based on distance and time.

With the advent of ridesharing services and mobile applications, the traditional taxi fare model has evolved. Some ridesharing services provide upfront pricing, allowing passengers to see the estimated fare before confirming a ride. Additionally, factors such as demand, route, and type of vehicle can influence the final fare.

It's important for passengers to be aware of the fare structure in their specific location and to confirm any additional fees or charges before starting a taxi ride.
